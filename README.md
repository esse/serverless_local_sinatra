# WARNING!

Do not run in production.

I'm not 100% sure about sanitization + it's slow. So, you know - you have been warned ;)

# Usage

Simply go to your serverless app directory and type `serverless_local_sinatra`. Port can be customized using `SERVERLESS_SINATRA_PORT` env var. Default is `9494`.

# Installation

`gem install serverless_local_sinatra`
